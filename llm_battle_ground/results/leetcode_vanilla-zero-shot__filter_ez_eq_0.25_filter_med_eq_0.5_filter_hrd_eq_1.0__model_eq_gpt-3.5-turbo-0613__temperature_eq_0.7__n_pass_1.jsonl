This method takes a string `s` and an integer `numRows` as input and returns a string. The goal of the method is to convert the input string into its zigzag pattern with a given number of rows.\n\nThe method begins by handling the edge case where `numRows` is 1. In this case, the zigzag pattern will be the same as the original string, so the method simply returns the original string.\n\nNext, a list `rows` of empty strings is created, with each string representing a row in the zigzag pattern.\n\nThe method then initializes the variables `index` and `step` for iterating through the rows. `index` represents the current row, and `step` represents the direction of movement through the rows. The initial values are `index = 0` and `step = 1`.\n\nThe method then iterates through each character in the input string. For each character, it adds the character to the corresponding row in the `rows` list.\n\nIf the current row is the first row (`index == 0`) or the last row (`index == numRows - 1`), the direction of movement (`step`) is reversed. This ensures that the zigzag pattern is followed correctly.\n\nAfter processing all the characters, the method combines all the rows in the `rows` list into a single string using the `join` method.\n\nFinally, the resulting string is returned as the output of the method.", "cleaned_response": "\nclass Solution:\n    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:\n        # edge case: if numRows is 1, the zigzag pattern will be the same as the original string\n        if numRows == 1:\n            return s\n        \n        # create a list of empty strings for each row\n        rows = [''] * numRows\n        \n        # initialize the variables for iterating through the rows\n        index = 0\n        step = 1\n        \n        # iterate through each character in the string\n        for char in s:\n            # add the character to the corresponding row\n            rows[index] += char\n            \n            # if we are at the first or last row, reverse the direction of the step\n            if index == 0:\n                step = 1\n            elif index == numRows - 1:\n                step = -1\n            \n            # move to the next row\n            index += step\n        \n        # combine all the rows into a single string\n        result = ''.join(rows)\n        \n        return result\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 2.0, "frontend_question_id": 6.0, "loc": 5}
{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #8\nTitle: String to Integer (atoi)\nDescription:\nImplement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function). The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows: Read in and ignore any leading whitespace. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored. Convert these digits into an integer (i. e. \"123\" -> 123, \"0032\" -> 32 ). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2). If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -2^31 should be clamped to -2^31, and integers greater than 2^31 - 1 should be clamped to 2^31 - 1. Return the integer as the final result. Note: Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character. Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits. Example 1: Input: s = \"42\" Output: 42 Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position. Step 1: \"42\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace) ^ Step 2: \"42\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+') ^ Step 3: \" 42 \" (\"42\" is read in) ^ The parsed integer is 42. Since 42 is in the range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], the final result is 42. Example 2: Input: s = \" -42\" Output: -42 Explanation: Step 1: \" -42\" (leading whitespace is read and ignored) ^ Step 2: \" - 42\" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative) ^ Step 3: \" - 42 \" (\"42\" is read in) ^ The parsed integer is -42. Since -42 is in the range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], the final result is -42. Example 3: Input: s = \"4193 with words\" Output: 4193 Explanation: Step 1: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace) ^ Step 2: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+') ^ Step 3: \" 4193 with words\" (\"4193\" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit) ^ The parsed integer is 4193. Since 4193 is in the range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], the final result is 4193.

All the strings of words are of the same length. A concatenated substring in s is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated. For example, if words = [\"ab\", \"cd\", \"ef\"], then \"abcdef\", \"abefcd\", \"cdabef\", \"cdefab\", \"efabcd\", and \"efcdab\" are all concatenated strings. \"acdbef\" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words. Return the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.

The substring starting at 0 is \"barfoo\". It is the concatenation of [\"bar\", \"foo\"] which is a permutation of words. The substring starting at 9 is \"foobar\". It is the concatenation of [\"foo\", \"bar\"] which is a permutation of words. The output order does not matter. Returning [9, 0] is fine too.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #31\nTitle: Next Permutation\nDescription:\nA permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order. For example, for arr = [1, 2, 3], the following are all the permutations of arr : [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]. The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i. e. , sorted in ascending order). For example, the next permutation of arr = [1, 2, 3] is [1, 3, 2]. Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2, 3, 1] is [3, 1, 2]. While the next permutation of arr = [3, 2, 1] is [1, 2, 3] because [3, 2, 1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement. Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums. The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory. Example 1: Input: nums = [1, 2, 3] Output: [1, 3, 2] Example 2: Input: nums = [3, 2, 1] Output: [1, 2, 3] Example 3: Input: nums = [1, 1, 5] Output: [1, 5, 1] Constraints: 1 <= nums.length <= 100^0 <= nums[i] <= 100\n", "code_prompt": "class Solution:\n    def nextPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.\n        \"\"\"\n        ", "raw_response": "```python\nclass Solution:\n    def nextPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Find the first decreasing element from the right\n        i = len(nums) - 2\n        while i >= 0 and nums[i] >= nums[i+1]:\n            i -= 1\n        \n        # If no such element is found, reverse the whole array\n        if i == -1:\n            nums.reverse()\n            return\n        \n        # Find the smallest element that is greater than nums[i] from the right\n        j = len(nums) - 1\n        while j > i and nums[j] <= nums[i]:\n            j -= 1\n        \n        # Swap nums[i] and nums[j]\n        nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]\n        \n        # Reverse the elements from i+1 to the end\n        start = i + 1\n        end = len(nums) - 1\n        while start < end:\n            nums[start], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[start]\n            start += 1\n            end -= 1\n```\n\nThe above code implements the `nextPermutation` function which finds the next lexicographically greater permutation of the given array of integers `nums`. It modifies the array in place without using any extra memory.\n\nThe approach used in this solution is as follows:\n\n1. Find the first decreasing element from the right. Let's call it `i`. This element will be swapped with a smaller element that is located to its right.\n2. If no such element is found, it means that the array is in descending order, which is the largest possible permutation. In this case, we reverse the whole array to get the smallest possible permutation.\n3. Find the smallest element that is greater than `nums[i]` from the right. Let's call it `j`.\n4. Swap `nums[i]` with `nums[j]`.\n5. Reverse the elements from `i+1` to the end of the array.\n\nThis algorithm guarantees that the resulting permutation will be the next lexicographically greater permutation.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #68\nTitle: Text Justification\nDescription:\nGiven an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified. You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters. Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right. For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words. Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only. Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth. The input array words contains at least one word. Example 1: Input: words = [\"This\", \"is\", \"an\", \"example\", \"of\", \"text\", \"justification. \"], maxWidth = 16 Output: [ \"This is an\", \"example of text\", \"justification. \" ] Example 2: Input: words = [\"What\", \"must\", \"be\", \"acknowledgment\", \"shall\", \"be\"], maxWidth = 16 Output: [ \"What must be\", \"acknowledgment \", \"shall be \" ] Explanation: Note that the last line is \"shall be \" instead of \"shall be\", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified. Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

Then, a new line is started with the current word.\n\nAfter processing all words, the last line is left justified using the `left_justify_line` function.\n\nThe `justify_line` function is responsible for distributing the extra spaces between words to ensure that the line has exactly `maxWidth` characters. If the line contains only one word, it is left justified by padding it with spaces on the right.\n\nThe `left_justify_line` function simply joins the words with a single space and adds extra spaces on the right to reach the maximum width.\n\nThe algorithm runs in linear time complexity, as it iterates through each word in the input list exactly once.", "cleaned_response": "\nfrom typing import List\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    def fullJustify(self, words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> List[str]:\n        result = []\n        current_line = []\n        current_length = 0\n        \n        for word in words:\n            # If adding the word exceeds the maximum width, justify the current line\n            if current_length + len(current_line) + len(word) > maxWidth:\n                result.append(self.justify_line(current_line, maxWidth))\n                current_line = []\n                current_length = 0\n            \n            current_line.append(word)\n            current_length += len(word)\n        \n        # Last line (left justification)\n        result.append(self.left_justify_line(current_line, maxWidth))\n        \n        return result\n    \n    def justify_line(self, words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> str:\n        # If the line contains only one word, left justify it\n        if len(words) == 1:\n            return words[0] + \" \" * (maxWidth - len(words[0]))\n        \n        word_length = sum(len(word) for word in words)\n        space_length = maxWidth - word_length\n        space_count = len(words) - 1\n        avg_space_length = space_length // space_count\n        extra_space_count = space_length % space_count\n        \n        line = \"\"\n        for i in range(len(words)):\n            line += words[i]\n            \n            # Add average number of spaces between words\n            if i != len(words) - 1:\n                line += \" \" * avg_space_length\n                \n                # Add extra space if there are remaining\n                if i < extra_space_count:\n                    line += \" \"\n        \n        return line\n    \n    def left_justify_line(self, words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> str:\n        line = \" \".join(words)\n        line += \" \" * (maxWidth - len(line))\n        \n        return line\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 3.0, "frontend_question_id": 68.0, "loc": 67}
{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #71\nTitle: Simplify Path\nDescription:\nGiven a string path, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/' ) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path. In a Unix-style file system, a period . refers to the current directory, a double period '. . ' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i. e. '//' ) are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '. . . ' are treated as file/directory names. The canonical path should have the following format: The path starts with a single slash '/'. Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'. The path does not end with a trailing '/'. The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i. e. , no period . or double period '. . ' ) Return the simplified canonical path. Example 1: Input: path = \"/home/\" Output: \"/home\" Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

The main idea is to maintain a window that contains all the characters of string t. Initially, the window is empty. We expand the window by moving the right pointer to the right until we find all the characters of t in the window. Then, we try to minimize the window length by moving the left pointer to the right and updating the window.\n\n1. Create a dictionary `t_freq` to store the frequency of characters in t.\n2. Initialize variables: \n   - `left` and `right` pointers to represent the window boundaries.\n   - `min_length` to store the minimum window length found so far (initialized to infinity).\n   - `count` to keep track of the number of characters in t found in the window.\n   - `min_window` to store the resultant minimum window substring.\n3. Slide the window by moving the right pointer to the right:\n   - Decrement the frequency of the character at the right pointer in `t_freq`.\n   - If the frequency becomes 0 or greater, increment `count` by 1.\n4. Update the window:\n   - If `count` is equal to the length of t, it means we have found all the characters of t in the window.\n   - Update the `min_length` and `min_window` if the current window length is smaller.\n   - Move the left pointer to the right and update the window:\n     - Increment the frequency of the character at the left pointer in `t_freq`.\n     - If the frequency becomes greater than 0, decrement `count` by 1.\n5. Return the `min_window`.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(m + n), where m is the length of string s and n is the length of string t. This is because we traverse both strings once (using the left and right pointers). The space complexity is O(n) since we use a dictionary to store the frequency of characters in t.", "cleaned_response": "\nclass Solution:\n    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n        # Step 1: Create a dictionary to store the frequency of characters in t\n        t_freq = {}\n        for char in t:\n            t_freq[char] = t_freq.get(char, 0) + 1\n        \n        # Step 2: Initialize variables\n        left = 0\n        min_length = float('inf')  # Set initial min length to infinity\n        count = 0  # Count of characters in t found in the window\n        min_window = \"\"  # Resultant minimum window substring\n        \n        # Step 3: Slide the window\n        for right in range(len(s)):\n            # Decrement the frequency of the character in t\n            if s[right] in t_freq:\n                t_freq[s[right]] -= 1\n                # If the frequency becomes 0, it means we have found all occurrences of the character in t\n                if t_freq[s[right]] >= 0:\n                    count += 1\n            \n            # Step 4: Update the window\n            while count == len(t):\n                # Update the minimum window substring if a smaller length is found\n                if right - left + 1 < min_length:\n                    min_length = right - left + 1\n                    min_window = s[left:right+1]\n                \n                # Increment the frequency of the character at the left pointer\n                if s[left] in t_freq:\n                    t_freq[s[left]] += 1\n                    # If the frequency becomes > 0, it means the character is no longer fully covered in the window\n                    if t_freq[s[left]] > 0:\n                        count -= 1\n                \n                # Move the left pointer\n                left += 1\n        \n        # Step 5: Return the minimum window substring\n        return min_window\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 3.0, "frontend_question_id": 76.0, "loc": 75}

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #87\nTitle: Scramble String\nDescription:\nWe can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:...\n If the length of the string is 1, stop. If the length of the string is > 1, do the following: Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i. e. , if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y. Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i. e. , after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x. Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y. Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false. Example 1: Input: s1 = \"great\", s2 = \"rgeat\" Output: true Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is: \"great\" --> \"gr/eat\" // divide at random index. \"gr/eat\" --> \"gr/eat\" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order. \"gr/eat\" --> \"g/r / e/at\" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them. \"g/r / e/at\" --> \"r/g / e/at\" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order. \"r/g / e/at\" --> \"r/g / e/ a/t\" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide \"at\" to \"a/t\". \"r/g / e/ a/t\" --> \"r/g / e/ a/t\" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order. The algorithm stops now, and the result string is \"rgeat\" which is s2. As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true. Example 2: Input: s1 = \"abcde\", s2 = \"caebd\" Output: false Example 3: Input: s1 = \"a\", s2 = \"a\" Output: true Constraints: s1.length == s2.length 1 <= s1.length <= 30 s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.\n", "code_prompt": "class Solution:\n    def isScramble(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n        ", "raw_response": "To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming and recursion to build a memoization table to store the results of subproblems. \n\nThe idea is to check if s1 and s2 are scrambled strings by recursively checking all possible splits and combinations of substrings. \n\nHere is the complete function definition:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isScramble(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n        # Check if strings are equal\n        if s1 == s2:\n            return True\n        \n        # Check if the characters in the two strings have the same frequency\n        if sorted(s1) != sorted(s2):\n            return False\n        \n        n = len(s1)\n        \n        # Create a 3D array to store the results of subproblems\n        dp = [[[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n        \n        # Iterate through the lengths of substrings\n        for length in range(1, n + 1):\n            # Iterate through the starting indices of substrings in s1 and s2\n            for i in range(n - length + 1):\n                for j in range(n - length + 1):\n                    # If the substrings are the same, set dp[length][i][j] to True\n                    if s1[i:i+length] == s2[j:j+length]:\n                        dp[length][i][j] = True\n                    else:\n                        # Iterate through possible split points of the substrings\n                        for k in range(1, length):\n                            # Check if the substrings are scramble strings\n                            if (dp[k][i][j] and dp[length-k][i+k][j+k]) or (dp[k][i][j+length-k] and dp[length-k][i+k][j]):\n                                dp[length][i][j] = True\n                                break\n        \n        # Return the result of the entire problem\n        return dp[n][0][0]\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n^4) and a space complexity of O(n^3), where n is the length of the strings.

A valid BST is defined as follows: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. Example 1: Input: root = [2, 1, 3] Output: true Example 2: Input: root = [5, 1, 4, null, null, 3, 6] Output: false Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

If it is, we return True, as an empty tree is considered a valid BST.\n- Next, we store the value of the current node in the `val` variable.\n- We then check if the value of the current node is not within the valid range defined by the `lower` and `upper` bounds. If it is not, we return False, as the tree is not a valid BST.\n- If the current node passes the above checks, we recursively call the `helper` function on the right subtree with the updated `lower` bound as the value of the current node and the same `upper` bound.\n- Similarly, we recursively call the `helper` function on the left subtree with the same `lower` bound and the value of the current node as the `upper` bound.\n- If either of these recursive calls returns False, we return False.\n- If all the above checks pass, we return True, indicating that the tree is a valid BST.\n- Finally, we call the `helper` function with the root of the tree as the initial node and return its result.", "cleaned_response": "\n# Definition for a binary tree node.\n# class TreeNode:\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n#         self.val = val\n#         self.left = left\n#         self.right = right\n\nclass Solution:\n    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:\n        def helper(node, lower=float('-inf'), upper=float('inf')):\n            if not node:\n                return True\n            \n            val = node.val\n            if val <= lower or val >= upper:\n                return False\n            \n            if not helper(node.right, val, upper):\n                return False\n            if not helper(node.left, lower, val):\n                return False\n            \n            return True\n        \n        return helper(root)\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 2.0, "frontend_question_id": 98.0, "loc": 97}

We maintain a helper function that takes the current node and the current number formed by the root-to-current-node path. If the current node is a leaf node, we return the current number. Otherwise, we recursively call the helper function on the left and right subtrees and return their sum. We also update the current number by multiplying it by 10 and adding the value of the current node.\n\nTime Complexity Analysis:\nThe time complexity for this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

Each node in the graph contains a value ( int ) and a list ( List[Node] ) of its neighbors. class Node { public int val; public List<Node> neighbors; } Test case format: For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list. An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the i th station to its next (i + 1) th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique Example 1: Input: gas = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], cost = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] Output: 3 Explanation: Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4 Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8 Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7 Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6 Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5 Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3. Therefore, return 3 as the starting index. Example 2: Input: gas = [2, 3, 4], cost = [3, 4, 3] Output: -1 Explanation: You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #165\nTitle: Compare Version Numbers\nDescription:\nGiven two version numbers, version1 and version2, compare them. Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot .. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example 2. 5. 33 and 0. 1 are valid version numbers. To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions 1 and 001 are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0. For example, version 1. 0 is less than version 1. 1 because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are 0 and 1 respectively, and 0 < 1. Return the following: If version1 < version2, return -1. If version1 > version2, return 1. Otherwise, return 0. Example 1: Input: version1 = \"1. 01\", version2 = \"1. 001\" Output: 0 Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both \"01\" and \"001\" represent the same integer \"1\". Example 2: Input: version1 = \"1. 0\", version2 = \"1. 0. 0\" Output: 0 Explanation: version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as \"0\". Example 3: Input: version1 = \"0. 1\", version2 = \"1. 1\" Output: -1 Explanation: version1's revision 0 is \"0\", while version2's revision 0 is \"1\". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

The dungeon consists of m x n rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through dungeon to rescue the princess. The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately. Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers). To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step. Return the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.

We create a DP array `dp` of length `len(nums) + 1` and initialize it with zeros. \n- We iterate over the input array starting from the second element (index 1) and calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed at each house. The maximum amount at each house is the maximum of skipping the current house (`dp[i-1]`) and robbing the current house and the house before it (`dp[i-2] + nums[i-1]`).\n- Finally, we return the maximum of robbing houses from the second to the last, and robbing houses from the first to the second last.

This is done to handle nested parentheses.\n\nWhen we encounter a ')' sign, we add the current `operand` to the `result`, reset the `operand` to 0, multiply the `result` by the sign stored in the stack (which is the sign before the parentheses), and add the result stored in the stack (which is the result before the parentheses) to the current `result`.\n\nFinally, we return the `result` plus the last number (based on the current sign stored in `sign`) since there are no more operators remaining.\n\nThe time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.", "cleaned_response": "\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        stack = []\n        operand = 0\n        result = 0\n        sign = 1 # 1 represents positive sign, -1 represents negative sign\n        \n        for ch in s:\n            if ch.isdigit():\n                operand = operand * 10 + int(ch)\n                \n            elif ch == '+':\n                result += sign * operand\n                operand = 0\n                sign = 1\n                \n            elif ch == '-':\n                result += sign * operand\n                operand = 0\n                sign = -1\n                \n            elif ch == '(':\n                stack.append(result)\n                stack.append(sign)\n                result = 0\n                sign = 1\n                \n            elif ch == ')':\n                result += sign * operand\n                operand = 0\n                result *= stack.pop() # pop the sign before the parenthesis\n                result += stack.pop() # add the result before the parenthesis to the current result\n                \n        return result + sign * operand\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 3.0, "frontend_question_id": 224.0, "loc": 199}

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia : \u201cThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself ). \u201d Example 1: Input: root = [6, 2, 8, 0, 4, 7, 9, null, null, 3, 5], p = 2, q = 8 Output: 6 Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

We traverse through the binary search tree starting from the root. At each node, we check if the node is equal to either of the given nodes (`p` or `q`). If it is, we return the node itself as the lowest common ancestor. If it's not equal to any of the nodes, we recursively search for the lowest common ancestor in the left and right subtrees. If both nodes are found in the subtrees, then the current node is the lowest common ancestor. If only one node is found, we return that node. If neither node is found, we return None.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, the itinerary [\"JFK\", \"LGA\"] has a smaller lexical order than [\"JFK\", \"LGB\"]. You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once. Example 1: Input: tickets = [[\"MUC\", \"LHR\"], [\"JFK\", \"MUC\"], [\"SFO\", \"SJC\"], [\"LHR\", \"SFO\"]] Output: [\"JFK\", \"MUC\", \"LHR\", \"SFO\", \"SJC\"] Example 2: Input: tickets = [[\"JFK\", \"SFO\"], [\"JFK\", \"ATL\"], [\"SFO\", \"ATL\"], [\"ATL\", \"JFK\"], [\"ATL\", \"SFO\"]] Output: [\"JFK\", \"ATL\", \"JFK\", \"SFO\", \"ATL\", \"SFO\"] Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is [\"JFK\", \"SFO\", \"ATL\", \"JFK\", \"ATL\", \"SFO\"] but it is larger in lexical order.

Return the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll (i. e. , put one inside the other). Note: You cannot rotate an envelope. Example 1: Input: envelopes = [[5, 4], [6, 4], [6, 7], [2, 3]] Output: 3 Explanation: The maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([2, 3] => [5, 4] => [6, 7]).

It first sorts the envelopes based on width in ascending order. If the widths are the same, it sorts based on height in descending order. This ensures that any nested envelopes are adjacent in the sorted array.\n\nThen, the solution initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of length `n` (number of envelopes) and sets all elements to 1. The value at `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of nested envelopes that can be achieved by considering the ith envelope.\n\nThe solution iterates through each envelope in the sorted array. For each envelope `envelopes[i]`, it checks if it can be nested inside any previous envelopes `envelopes[j]`. If the height of `envelopes[i]` is greater than the height of `envelopes[j]`, it means `envelopes[i]` can be nested inside `envelopes[j]`. In such case, the solution updates the value at `dp[i]` by taking the maximum of the current value and `dp[j] + 1`.\n\nFinally, the solution returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the maximum number of envelopes that can be nested.", "cleaned_response": "\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxEnvelopes(self, envelopes: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Sort the envelopes based on the width in ascending order\n        # If the widths are the same, sort based on height in descending order\n        envelopes.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))\n        \n        n = len(envelopes)\n        dp = [1] * n\n        \n        # Iterate through each envelope and check if it can be nested inside any previous envelopes\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i):\n                if envelopes[i][1] > envelopes[j][1]:\n                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n        \n        return max(dp)\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 3.0, "frontend_question_id": 354.0, "loc": 277}

This is important because any number that is divisible by another number can only appear after it in the sorted array.\n\nNext, we need to keep track of two arrays: `dp` and `prev`.\n\n- `dp` is an array that stores the length of the largest divisible subset ending at `nums[i]`.\n- `prev` is an array that stores the index of the previous number in the largest divisible subset ending at `nums[i]`.\n\nWe initialize `dp` and `prev` arrays with 1s, as the minimum length of a subset is always 1 (the number itself).\n\nThen, we iterate through the sorted array `nums` from left to right. For each number at index `i`, we iterate from index 0 to `i-1` to check if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If it is divisible and the length of the divisible subset ending at `nums[j]` plus 1 is greater than the current length at `dp[i]`, we update `dp[i]` and `prev[i]`.\n\nAfter the iteration, we find the maximum value in the `dp` array and its corresponding index `max_index`. This index will represent the last element of the largest divisible subset.\n\nFinally, we use the `prev` array to backtrack and construct the largest divisible subset by starting from `max_index` and adding the corresponding element to the subset. We repeat this process until we reach the first element.\n\nHere is the final implementation:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def largestDivisibleSubset(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        nums.sort() # Sort the input array in ascending order\n        \n        n = len(nums)\n        dp = [1] * n\n        prev = [-1] * n\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i):\n                if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:\n                    if dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]:\n                        dp[i] = dp[j] + 1\n                        prev[i] = j\n        \n        max_len = max(dp)\n        max_index = dp.index(max_len)\n        \n        subset = []\n        while max_index != -1:\n            subset.append(nums[max_index])\n            max_index = prev[max_index]\n        \n        return subset[::-1] # Reverse the subset to get the correct order\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop, where n is the length of the input array `nums`.", "cleaned_response": "\nclass Solution:\n    def largestDivisibleSubset(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        nums.sort() # Sort the input array in ascending order\n        \n        n = len(nums)\n        dp = [1] * n\n        prev = [-1] * n\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i):\n                if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:\n                    if dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]:\n                        dp[i] = dp[j] + 1\n                        prev[i] = j\n        \n        max_len = max(dp)\n        max_index = dp.index(max_len)\n        \n        subset = []\n        while max_index != -1:\n            subset.append(nums[max_index])\n            max_index = prev[max_index]\n        \n        return subset[::-1] # Reverse the subset to get the correct order\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 2.0, "frontend_question_id": 368.0, "loc": 283}

You guess a number. If you guess the right number, you win the game. If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing. Every time you guess a wrong number x, you will pay x dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game. Given a particular n, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick.

Otherwise, you pay $7. - If my number is higher, the range is [8, 10]. Guess 9. - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9. - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #376\nTitle: Wiggle Subsequence\nDescription:\nA wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences. For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative. In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order. Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums. Example 1: Input: nums = [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] Output: 6 Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3). Example 2: Input: nums = [1, 17, 5, 10, 13, 15, 10, 5, 16, 8] Output: 7 Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).

It maintains two variables `up` and `down` to keep track of the lengths of the increasing and decreasing subsequences respectively. \n\nStarting from the second element in the list, the algorithm compares the current element with the previous element. If the current element is greater than the previous element, it means an increasing subsequence is formed, so we update `up` by incrementing `down` by 1 (to account for the difference in lengths). If the current element is smaller than the previous element, it means a decreasing subsequence is formed, so we update `down` by incrementing `up` by 1. \n\nFinally, we return the maximum of `up` and `down` as the length of the longest wiggle subsequence.", "cleaned_response": "\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        if n < 2:\n            return n\n        \n        up = down = 1\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:\n                up = down + 1\n            elif nums[i] < nums[i-1]:\n                down = up + 1\n        \n        return max(up, down)\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 2.0, "frontend_question_id": 376.0, "loc": 289}

We initialize the `low` variable to be the smallest element in the matrix and the `high` variable to be the largest element in the matrix. We repeatedly calculate the `mid` value and count the number of elements in the matrix that are less than or equal to `mid`. Based on the count, we adjust the range of `low` and `high` until `low` becomes equal to `high`, which indicates that we have found the kth smallest element.\n\nThe `countElements` function counts the number of elements in the matrix that are less than or equal to the target value. It starts from the bottom-left corner of the matrix and moves towards the top-right corner. If an element is less than or equal to the target, it increments the count by the number of elements in the current column, since all elements above it in the same column are also less than or equal to the target. If an element is greater than the target, it moves to the previous row.\n\nThe time complexity of the `kthSmallest` function is O(n log(max - min)), where n is the size of the matrix and max - min is the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the matrix. The space complexity is O(1).\n\nNow, let's run the given test cases to verify that our final solution is correct.\n\n```python\nmatrix1 = [[1, 5, 9], [10, 11, 13], [12, 13, 15]]\nk1 = 8\n# The elements in the matrix are [1, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 15], and the 8th smallest number is 13\n\nmatrix2 = [[-5]]\nk2 = 1\n# The only element in the matrix is -5, and it is the 1st smallest number\n\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.kthSmallest(matrix1, k1))\nprint(solution.kthSmallest(matrix2, k2))\n```\n\nThe output of the above test cases should be:\n\n```\n13\n-5\n```\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that our final implementation is correct.", "cleaned_response": "\nmatrix1 = [[1, 5, 9], [10, 11, 13], [12, 13, 15]]\nk1 = 8\n# The elements in the matrix are [1, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 15], and the 8th smallest number is 13\n\nmatrix2 = [[-5]]\nk2 = 1\n# The only element in the matrix is -5, and it is the 1st smallest number\n\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.kthSmallest(matrix1, k1))\nprint(solution.kthSmallest(matrix2, k2))\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 2.0, "frontend_question_id": 378.0, "loc": 291}

It should support inserting and removing specific elements and also reporting a random element. Implement the RandomizedCollection class: RandomizedCollection() Initializes the empty RandomizedCollection object. bool insert(int val) Inserts an item val into the multiset, even if the item is already present. Returns true if the item is not present, false otherwise. bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the multiset if present. Returns true if the item is present, false otherwise. Note that if val has multiple occurrences in the multiset, we only remove one of them. int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current multiset of elements. The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of the same values the multiset contains. You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works on average O(1) time complexity. Note: The test cases are generated such that getRandom will only be called if there is at least one item in the RandomizedCollection.

Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3. Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1. Hence [[5, 0], [7, 0], [5, 2], [6, 1], [4, 4], [7, 1]] is the reconstructed queue.

This method takes a string `s` and an integer `k` as input and returns an integer, which represents the length of the longest substring containing the same letter after performing the given operations.\n\nThe algorithm uses a sliding window approach to solve the problem. It maintains a window of characters and counts the number of occurrences of each character in the window using a `count_dict` dictionary. The maximum count of any character in the window is stored in the `max_count` variable.\n\nThe algorithm iterates through the string `s` using a for loop.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #427\nTitle: Construct Quad Tree\nDescription:\nGiven a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent grid with a Quad-Tree. Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing grid. A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes: val : True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer. isLeaf : True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children. class Node { public boolean val; public boolean isLeaf; public Node topLeft; public Node topRight; public Node bottomLeft; public Node bottomRight; } We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps: If the current grid has the same value (i. e all 1's or all 0's ) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop. If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo. Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid. If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki. Quad-Tree format: You don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below. It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val]. If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0. Example 1: Input: grid = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] Output: [[0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0]] Explanation: The explanation of this example is shown below: Notice that 0 represents False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree. Example 2: Input: grid = [[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]] Output: [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0], null, null, null, null, [1, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 1]] Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids. The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value. The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #430\nTitle: Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List\nDescription:\nYou are given a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer, a previous pointer, and an additional child pointer. This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure as shown in the example below. Given the head of the first level of the list, flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let curr be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear after curr and before curr. next in the flattened list. Return the head of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their child pointers set to null. Example 1: Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, null, null, null, 7, 8, 9, 10, null, null, 11, 12] Output: [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 9, 10, 4, 5, 6] Explanation: The multilevel linked list in the input is shown.

The serialization becomes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, null] | [null, null, 7, 8, 9, 10, null] | [ null, 11, 12, null] Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, null, null, null, 7, 8, 9, 10, null, null, 11, 12]\n", "code_prompt": "\"\"\"\n# Definition for a Node.\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, val, prev, next, child):\n        self.val = val\n        self.prev = prev\n        self.next = next\n        self.child = child\n\"\"\"\n\nclass Solution:\n    def flatten(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':\n        ", "raw_response": "```python\n# Definition for a Node.\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, val, prev, next, child):\n        self.val = val\n        self.prev = prev\n        self.next = next\n        self.child = child\n\nclass Solution:\n    def flatten(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':\n        if not head:\n            return head\n        \n        curr = head\n        stack = []\n        \n        while curr:\n            if curr.child:\n                if curr.next:\n                    stack.append(curr.next)\n                curr.next = curr.child\n                curr.child.prev = curr\n                curr.child = None\n            elif not curr.next and stack:\n                nextNode = stack.pop()\n                curr.next = nextNode\n                nextNode.prev = curr\n            \n            curr = curr.next\n        \n        return head\n```\n\nThe final solution uses an iterative approach and a stack to flatten the multilevel doubly linked list.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #458\nTitle: Poor Pigs\nDescription:\nThere are buckets buckets of liquid, where exactly one of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have minutesToTest minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous. You can feed the pigs according to these steps: Choose some live pigs to feed. For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs. Wait for minutesToDie minutes. You may not feed any other pigs during this time. After minutesToDie minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive. Repeat this process until you run out of time. Given buckets, minutesToDie, and minutesToTest, return the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time. Example 1: Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15 Output: 2 Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows: At time 0, feed the first pig buckets 1 and 2, and feed the second pig buckets 2 and 3. At time 15, there are 4 possible outcomes: - If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous. - If only the second pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous. - If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous. - If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous. Example 2: Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 30 Output: 2 Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows: At time 0, feed the first pig bucket 1, and feed the second pig bucket 2. At time 15, there are 2 possible outcomes: - If either pig dies, then the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed. - If neither pig dies, then feed the first pig bucket 3, and feed the second pig bucket 4. At time 30, one of the two pigs must die, and the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #460\nTitle: LFU Cache\nDescription:\nDesign and implement a data structure for a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache. Implement the LFUCache class: LFUCache(int capacity) Initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure. int get(int key) Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1. void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i. e. , two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated. To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key. When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it. The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

If they are equal, it increments `j` and if `j` reaches the end of `s2`, it increments `count2`, resets `j` to 0 (as a complete instance of `s2` has been found), and continues iterating.\n\nThe loop also increments `i` and if `i` reaches the end of `s1`, it increments `count1` to mark the completion of a repetition of `s1` and resets `i` to 0.\n\nFinally, the code returns the maximum number of times `s2` can be repeated in `str1` by dividing `count2` by `n2`.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n1 * len(s1)), where n1 is the repetition count of `s1`, and a space complexity of O(len(s1) + len(s2)).", "cleaned_response": "\nclass Solution:\n    def getMaxRepetitions(self, s1: str, n1: int, s2: str, n2: int) -> int:\n        if not set(s2).issubset(set(s1)):\n            return 0\n        \n        count1 = count2 = i = j = 0\n        while count1 < n1:\n            if s1[i] == s2[j]:\n                j += 1\n                if j == len(s2):\n                    count2 += 1\n                    j = 0\n            i += 1\n            if i == len(s1):\n                count1 += 1\n                i = 0\n        \n        return count2 // n2\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 3.0, "frontend_question_id": 466.0, "loc": 367}

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #488\nTitle: Zuma Game\nDescription:\nYou are playing a variation of the game Zuma. In this variation of Zuma, there is a single row of colored balls on a board, where each ball can be colored red 'R', yellow 'Y', blue 'B', green 'G', or white 'W'. You also have several colored balls in your hand. Your goal is to clear all of the balls from the board. On each turn: Pick any ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row. If there is a group of three or more consecutive balls of the same color, remove the group of balls from the board. If this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left. If there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game. Repeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand. Given a string board, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string hand, representing the balls in your hand, return the minimum number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board. If you cannot clear all the balls from the board using the balls in your hand, return -1. Example 1: Input: board = \"WRRBBW\", hand = \"RB\" Output: -1 Explanation: It is impossible to clear all the balls. The best you can do is: - Insert 'R' so the board becomes WRR R BBW. W RRR BBW -> WBBW. - Insert 'B' so the board becomes WBB B W. W BBB W -> WW. There are still balls remaining on the board, and you are out of balls to insert. Example 2: Input: board = \"WWRRBBWW\", hand = \"WRBRW\" Output: 2 Explanation: To make the board empty: - Insert 'R' so the board becomes WWRR R BBWW. WW RRR BBWW -> WWBBWW. - Insert 'B' so the board becomes WWBB B WW. WW BBB WW -> WWWW -> empty. 2 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board. Example 3: Input: board = \"G\", hand = \"GGGGG\" Output: 2 Explanation: To make the board empty: - Insert 'G' so the board becomes G G. - Insert 'G' so the board becomes GG G. GGG -> empty. 2 balls from your hand were needed to clear the board. Constraints: 1 <= board.length <= 16^1 <= hand.length <= 5 board and hand consist of the characters 'R', 'Y', 'B', 'G', and 'W'.

The `reversePairs` method takes in a list of integers `nums` and returns the number of reverse pairs in the array.\n\nThe `reversePairs` method utilizes a modified version of the merge sort algorithm to count the reverse pairs. It first calls the `mergeSort` function passing in the `nums` list, start index 0, and end index len(nums)-1. \n\nThe `mergeSort` function takes in the `nums` list, start index, and end index. It performs a merge sort on the `nums` list and returns the count of reverse pairs. It recursively divides the `nums` list into halves and calls itself on each half.

In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects. You are given n projects where the i th project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it. Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital. Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital. The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer. Example 1: Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1, 2, 3], capital = [0, 1, 1] Output: 4 Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0. After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1. With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2. Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital. Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

It first sorts the projects by their capital in ascending order. Then, it iterates through the projects, adding all the projects with capital less than or equal to the current wealth to the available projects heap. It chooses the project with the maximum profit from the available projects heap and increases the wealth by that profit.

If the character key[i] has been aligned at the \"12:00\" direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as one step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling. Example 1: Input: ring = \"godding\", key = \"gd\" Output: 4 Explanation: For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring \"godding\" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become \"ddinggo\". Also, we need 1 more step for spelling. So the final output is 4. Example 2: Input: ring = \"godding\", key = \"godding\" Output: 13 Constraints: 1 <= ring.length, key.length <= 100 ring and key consist of only lower case English letters.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #552\nTitle: Student Attendance Record II\nDescription:\nAn attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:...\n 'A' : Absent. 'L' : Late. 'P' : Present. Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria: The student was absent ( 'A' ) for strictly fewer than 2 days total. The student was never late ( 'L' ) for 3 or more consecutive days. Given an integer n, return the number of possible attendance records of length n that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo 10e9 + 7. Example 1: Input: n = 2 Output: 8 Explanation: There are 8 records with length 2 that are eligible for an award: \"PP\", \"AP\", \"PA\", \"LP\", \"PL\", \"AL\", \"LA\", \"LL\" Only \"AA\" is not eligible because there are 2 absences (there need to be fewer than 2).

Then, we iterate from 3 to n and update dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3]. This represents the number of possible records that end with \"P\", \"L\", and \"A\" respectively.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of records that have \"A\" at a specific position. We iterate from 1 to n and add the product of dp[i-1] and dp[n-i] to the answer. This represents the number of possible records with \"A\" at the i-th position and the remaining records of length n-i.\n\nFinally, we return the answer modulo MOD.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n).", "cleaned_response": "\nclass Solution:\n    def checkRecord(self, n: int) -> int:\n        MOD = int(1e9) + 7\n        \n        if n == 1:\n            return 3\n        elif n == 2:\n            return 8\n        \n        dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n        dp[0] = 1\n        dp[1] = 2\n        dp[2] = 4\n        \n        for i in range(3, n+1):\n            dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3]) % MOD\n        \n        ans = dp[n]\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            ans += (dp[i-1] * dp[n-i]) % MOD\n            ans %= MOD\n        \n        return ans\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 3.0, "frontend_question_id": 552.0, "loc": 432}

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #558\nTitle: Logical OR of Two Binary Grids Represented as Quad-Trees\nDescription:\nA Binary Matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are either 0 or 1. Given quadTree1 and quadTree2. quadTree1 represents a n * n binary matrix and quadTree2 represents another n * n binary matrix. Return a Quad-Tree representing the n * n binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by quadTree1 and quadTree2. Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer. A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes: val : True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. isLeaf : True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children. class Node { public boolean val; public boolean isLeaf; public Node topLeft; public Node topRight; public Node bottomLeft; public Node bottomRight; } We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps: If the current grid has the same value (i. e all 1's or all 0's ) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop. If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo. Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid. If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki. Quad-Tree format: The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below. It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val]. If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0. Example 1: Input: quadTree1 = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0], [1, 0]], quadTree2 = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0], null, null, null, null, [1, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 1]] Output: [[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0]] Explanation: quadTree1 and quadTree2 are shown above. You can see the binary matrix which is represented by each Quad-Tree. If we apply logical bitwise OR on the two binary matrices we get the binary matrix below which is represented by the result Quad-Tree. Notice that the binary matrices shown are only for illustration, you don't have to construct the binary matrix to get the result tree. Example 2: Input: quadTree1 = [[1, 0]], quadTree2 = [[1, 0]] Output: [[1, 0]] Explanation: Each tree represents a binary matrix of size 11. Each matrix contains only zero. The resulting matrix is of size 11. with also zero.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #591\nTitle: Tag Validator\nDescription:\nGiven a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold: The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid. A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid. A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1, 9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid. A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid. A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested. A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid). The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>. CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters. Example 1: Input: code = \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\" Output: true Explanation: The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. Although CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag. So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true. Example 2: Input: code = \"<DIV>>> ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\" Output: true Explanation: We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag. start_tag -> \"<DIV>\" end_tag -> \"</DIV>\" tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2. text1 -> \">> ![cdata[]] \" cdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\" text2 -> \"]]>>]\" The reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6. The reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7. Example 3: Input: code = \"<A> <B> </A> </B>\" Output: false Explanation: Unbalanced. If \"<A>\" is closed, then \"<B>\" must be unmatched, and vice versa.

Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #636\nTitle: Exclusive Time of Functions\nDescription:\nOn a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1. Function calls are stored in a call stack : when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp. You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the i th log message formatted as a string \"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\". For example, \"0:start:3\" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and \"1:end:2\" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively. A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3. Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the i th index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i. Example 1: Input: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\", \"1:start:2\", \"1:end:5\", \"0:end:6\"] Output: [3, 4] Explanation: Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1. Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5. Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time. So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing. Example 2: Input: n = 1, logs = [\"0:start:0\", \"0:start:2\", \"0:end:5\", \"0:start:6\", \"0:end:6\", \"0:end:7\"] Output: [8] Explanation: Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself. Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time. Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again. Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time. Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time. So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing. Example 3: Input: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\", \"0:start:2\", \"0:end:5\", \"1:start:6\", \"1:end:6\", \"0:end:7\"] Output: [7, 1] Explanation: Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself. Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time. Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1. Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6. Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time. So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #639\nTitle: Decode Ways II\nDescription:\nA message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:...\n 'A' -> \"1\" 'B' -> \"2\". . . 'Z' -> \"26\" To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, \"11106\" can be mapped into: \"AAJF\" with the grouping (1^1 10e6) \"KJF\" with the grouping (11 10e6) Note that the grouping (1^11 06) is invalid because \"06\" cannot be mapped into 'F' since \"6\" is different from \"06\". In addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the '*' character, which can represent any digit from '1' to '9' ( '0' is excluded). For example, the encoded message \"1*\" may represent any of the encoded messages \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \"16\", \"17\", \"18\", or \"19\". Decoding \"1*\" is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent. Given a string s consisting of digits and '*' characters, return the number of ways to decode it. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10e9 + 7. Example 1: Input: s = \"*\" Output: 9 Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", or \"9\". Each of these can be decoded to the strings \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", and \"I\" respectively. Hence, there are a total of 9 ways to decode \"*\". Example 2: Input: s = \"1*\" Output: 18 Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\", \"15\", \"16\", \"17\", \"18\", or \"19\". Each of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e. g. \"11\" can be decoded to \"AA\" or \"K\"). Hence, there are a total of 9 * 2 = 18 ways to decode \"1*\". Example 3: Input: s = \"2*\" Output: 15 Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages \"21\", \"22\", \"23\", \"24\", \"25\", \"26\", \"27\", \"28\", or \"29\". \"21\", \"22\", \"23\", \"24\", \"25\", and \"26\" have 2 ways of being decoded, but \"27\", \"28\", and \"29\" only have 1 way. Hence, there are a total of (6 * 2) + (3 * 1) = 12 + 3 = 15 ways to decode \"2*\".

Example 1: Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 4, 7] Output: 3 Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1, 3, 5] with length 3. Even though [1, 3, 5, 7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element 4. Example 2: Input: nums = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] Output: 1 Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly increasing.

If it is, it returns 0, as there is no sequence in an empty list.\n\nOtherwise, it initializes two variables: `longest` and `current` to 1. `longest` will keep track of the length of the longest subsequence seen so far, while `current` will keep track of the length of the current subsequence.\n\nThe function then iterates through the input list starting from index 1. For each iteration, it checks if the current element is greater than the previous element. If it is, it means that the subsequence is still strictly increasing, so `current` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, it means that the subsequence has been broken, so `current` is reset to 1.\n\nAfter each iteration, the function updates `longest` by taking the maximum value between `longest` and `current`.\n\nFinally, the function returns `longest`, which represents the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence in the input list.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

The forest is represented as an m x n matrix. In this matrix:...\n 0 means the cell cannot be walked through. 1 represents an empty cell that can be walked through. A number greater than 1 represents a tree in a cell that can be walked through, and this number is the tree's height. In one step, you can walk in any of the four directions: north, east, south, and west. If you are standing in a cell with a tree, you can choose whether to cut it off. You must cut off the trees in order from shortest to tallest. When you cut off a tree, the value at its cell becomes 1 (an empty cell). Starting from the point (0, 0), return the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees. If you cannot cut off all the trees, return -1. Note: The input is generated such that no two trees have the same height, and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off. Example 1: Input: forest = [[1, 2, 3], [0, 0, 4], [7, 6, 5]] Output: 6 Explanation: Following the path above allows you to cut off the trees from shortest to tallest in 6 steps. Example 2: Input: forest = [[1, 2, 3], [0, 0, 0], [7, 6, 5]] Output: -1 Explanation: The trees in the bottom row cannot be accessed as the middle row is blocked.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #688\nTitle: Knight Probability in Chessboard\nDescription:\nOn an n x n chessboard, a knight starts at the cell (row, column) and attempts to make exactly k moves. The rows and columns are 0-indexed, so the top-left cell is (0, 0), and the bottom-right cell is (n - 1, n - 1). A chess knight has eight possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction. Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there. The knight continues moving until it has made exactly k moves or has moved off the chessboard. Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving. Example 1: Input: n = 3, k = 2, row = 0, column = 0 Output: 0. 06250 Explanation: There are two moves (to (1, 2), (2, 1)) that will keep the knight on the board. From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board. The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0. 0625.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #699\nTitle: Falling Squares\nDescription:\nThere are several squares being dropped onto the X-axis of a 2D plane. You are given a 2D integer array positions where positions[i] = [left i, sideLength i ] represents the i th square with a side length of sideLength i that is dropped with its left edge aligned with X-coordinate left i. Each square is dropped one at a time from a height above any landed squares. It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved. After each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares. Return an integer array ans where ans[i] represents the height described above after dropping the i th square. Example 1: Input: positions = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [6, 1]] Output: [2, 5, 5] Explanation: After the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 2. After the second drop, the tallest stack is squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5. After the third drop, the tallest stack is still squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5. Thus, we return an answer of [2, 5, 5]. Example 2: Input: positions = [[100, 100], [200, 100]] Output: [100, 100] Explanation: After the first drop, the tallest stack is square 1 with a height of 100. After the second drop, the tallest stack is either square 1 or square 2, both with heights of 100. Thus, we return an answer of [100, 100]. Note that square 2 only brushes the right side of square 1, which does not count as landing on it.

At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.

Deleting \"e\" from \"leet\" adds 101[e] to the sum. At the end, both strings are equal to \"let\", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.

For each cell `(i, j)`, if the characters `s1[i-1]` and `s2[j-1]` are equal, we set `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i-1][j-1]` because no deletion is required. Otherwise, we take the minimum of the cumulative ASCII sum of deleting `s1[i-1]` from `s1` and the cumulative ASCII sum of deleting `s2[j-1]` from `s2`, and add it to `dp[i][j]`.\n\nFinally, we return the minimum ASCII sum at the bottom-right cell `dp[-1][-1]`, which represents the minimum number of deletions needed to make `s1` and `s2` equal.", "cleaned_response": "\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumDeleteSum(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> int:\n        # Create a 2D array of size (m+1)x(n+1) to store the minimum ASCII sum\n        # Initialize the first row and column with cumulative ASCII sum of characters\n        dp = [[0] * (len(s2) + 1) for _ in range(len(s1) + 1)]\n        \n        for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):\n            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + ord(s1[i-1])\n        \n        for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):\n            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + ord(s2[j-1])\n        \n        # Iterate through the remaining cells of the array\n        for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):\n            for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):\n                # If the characters are equal, no deletion is required\n                if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n                else:\n                    # If the characters are not equal, find the minimum ASCII sum\n                    # by either deleting the character from s1 or s2\n                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] + ord(s1[i-1]), dp[i][j-1] + ord(s2[j-1]))\n        \n        # Return the minimum ASCII sum at the bottom-right cell\n        return dp[-1][-1]\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 2.0, "frontend_question_id": 712.0, "loc": 537}

This is done by checking if `nums1[i-1]` is equal to `nums2[j-1]`. If they are equal, then the length of the common subarray ending at `nums1[i-1]` and `nums2[j-1]` is `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.

It returns the `k`th smallest distance among all the pairs of integers in the `nums` list. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the smallest distance.\n\nThe algorithm first sorts the `nums` list in ascending order. Then, it initializes two variables `low` and `high` to track the range of possible distances. The variable `low` starts at 0, and `high` is set to the maximum possible distance between the first and last elements of the sorted `nums` list.\n\nThe algorithm then enters a binary search loop. In each iteration, it calculates the middle distance `mid` between `low` and `high`. It then iterates over the `nums` list and counts the number of distances less than or equal to `mid`. If the count is less than `k`, it means that the `k`th smallest distance is greater than `mid`, so the algorithm updates `low` to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, if the count is greater than or equal to `k`, it means that the `k`th smallest distance is less than or equal to `mid`, so the algorithm updates `high` to `mid`.\n\nThe binary search loop continues until `low` is equal to `high`. At this point, the smallest distance has been found, and `low` represents that distance. The algorithm returns `low` as the result.\n\nThe time complexity of the algorithm is O(nlog(n) + nlog(diff)), where n is the length of the `nums` list and `diff` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the `nums` list.", "cleaned_response": "\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def smallestDistancePair(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        nums.sort()  # Sort the numbers in ascending order\n        n = len(nums)\n        low = 0\n        high = nums[-1] - nums[0]  # Get the maximum possible distance\n        \n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            count = 0\n            j = 0\n            \n            for i in range(n):\n                while j < n and nums[j] - nums[i] <= mid:\n                    j += 1\n                count += j - i - 1  # Count the number of distances less than or equal to mid\n            \n            if count < k:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        \n        return low\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 3.0, "frontend_question_id": 719.0, "loc": 543}

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #722\nTitle: Remove Comments\nDescription:\nGiven a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the i th line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\\n'. In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments. The string \"//\" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored. The string \"/*\" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of \"*/\" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right. ) To be clear, the string \"/*/\" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning. The first effective comment takes precedence over others. For example, if the string \"//\" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string \"/*\" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored. If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty. There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters. For example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case. Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments. It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so \"/*\" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment. Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details. After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format. Example 1: Input: source = [\"/*Test program */\", \"int main()\", \"{ \", \" // variable declaration \", \"int a, b, c;\", \"/* This is a test\", \" multiline \", \" comment for \", \" testing */\", \"a = b + c;\", \"}\"] Output: [\"int main()\", \"{ \", \" \", \"int a, b, c;\", \"a = b + c;\", \"}\"] Explanation: The line by line code is visualized as below: /*Test program */ int main() { // variable declaration int a, b, c; /* This is a test multiline comment for testing */ a = b + c; } The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments. The line by line output code is visualized as below: int main() { int a, b, c; a = b + c; } Example 2: Input: source = [\"a/*comment\", \"line\", \"more_comment*/b\"] Output: [\"ab\"] Explanation: The original source string is \"a/*comment\\nline\\nmore_comment*/b\", where we have bolded the newline characters. After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string \"ab\", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [\"ab\"]. Constraints: 1 <= source.length <= 100^0 <= source[i].length <= 80 source[i] consists of printable ASCII characters. Every open block comment is eventually closed.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #726\nTitle: Number of Atoms\nDescription:\nGiven a string formula representing a chemical formula, return the count of each atom. The atomic element always starts with an uppercase character, then zero or more lowercase letters, representing the name. One or more digits representing that element's count may follow if the count is greater than 1. If the count is 1, no digits will follow. For example, \"H2O\" and \"H2O2\" are possible, but \"H1O2\" is impossible. Two formulas are concatenated together to produce another formula. For example, \"H2O2He3Mg4\" is also a formula. A formula placed in parentheses, and a count (optionally added) is also a formula. For example, \"(H2O2)\" and \"(H2O2)3\" are formulas.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #736\nTitle: Parse Lisp Expression\nDescription:\nYou are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of. The syntax for these expressions is given as follows. An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer. (An integer could be positive or negative. ) A let expression takes the form \"(let v 1 e 1 v 2 e 2. . . v n e n expr)\", where let is always the string \"let\", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v 1 is assigned the value of the expression e 1, the second variable v 2 is assigned the value of the expression e 2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr. An add expression takes the form \"(add e 1 e 2 )\" where add is always the string \"add\", there are always two expressions e 1, e 2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e 1 and the evaluation of e 2. A mult expression takes the form \"(mult e 1 e 2 )\" where mult is always the string \"mult\", there are always two expressions e 1, e 2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2. For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names \"add\", \"let\", and \"mult\" are protected and will never be used as variable names. Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope. Example 1: Input: expression = \"(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))\" Output: 14 Explanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x, we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate. Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3. Example 2: Input: expression = \"(let x 3 x 2 x)\" Output: 2 Explanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially. Example 3: Input: expression = \"(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))\" Output: 5 Explanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x. The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.

We update the result array at the popped index with the number of days to wait.\n- We continue this process until the current element is not greater than the element at the top of the stack, or the stack becomes empty. This ensures that we calculate the number of days to wait for each element in the temperatures array.\n- Finally, we return the result array.

Return the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following the rules below : Starting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (n - 1, n - 1) by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1 ). After reaching (n - 1, n - 1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path cells.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #749\nTitle: Contain Virus\nDescription:\nA virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls. The world is modeled as an m x n binary grid isInfected, where isInfected[i][j] == 0 represents uninfected cells, and isInfected[i][j] == 1 represents cells contaminated with the virus. A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary. Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall. Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region (i. e. , the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night). There will never be a tie. Return the number of walls used to quarantine all the infected regions. If the world will become fully infected, return the number of walls used. Example 1: Input: isInfected = [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] Output: 10 Explanation: There are 2 contaminated regions. On the first day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the left. The board after the virus spreads is: On the second day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the right. The virus is fully contained. Example 2: Input: isInfected = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]] Output: 4 Explanation: Even though there is only one cell saved, there are 4 walls built. Notice that walls are only built on the shared boundary of two different cells. Example 3: Input: isInfected = [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] Output: 13 Explanation: The region on the left only builds two new walls. Constraints: m == isInfected.length n == isInfected[i].length 1 <= m, n <= 50 isInfected[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #753\nTitle: Cracking the Safe\nDescription:\nThere is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of n digits where each digit can be in the range [0, k - 1]. The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the most recent n digits that were entered each time you type a digit. For example, the correct password is \"345\" and you enter in \"012345\" : After typing 0, the most recent 3 digits is \"0\", which is incorrect. After typing 1, the most recent 3 digits is \"01\", which is incorrect. After typing 2, the most recent 3 digits is \"012\", which is incorrect. After typing 3, the most recent 3 digits is \"123\", which is incorrect. After typing 4, the most recent 3 digits is \"234\", which is incorrect. After typing 5, the most recent 3 digits is \"345\", which is correct and the safe unlocks. Return any string of minimum length that will unlock the safe at some point of entering it. Example 1: Input: n = 1, k = 2 Output: \"10\" Explanation: The password is a single digit, so enter each digit. \"01\" would also unlock the safe. Example 2: Input: n = 2, k = 2 Output: \"01100\" Explanation: For each possible password: - \"00\" is typed in starting from the 4 th digit. - \"01\" is typed in starting from the 1 st digit. - \"10\" is typed in starting from the 3 rd digit. - \"11\" is typed in starting from the 2 nd digit. Thus \"01100\" will unlock the safe. \"10011\", and \"11001\" would also unlock the safe.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #756\nTitle: Pyramid Transition Matrix\nDescription:\nYou are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single letter. Each row of blocks contains one less block than the row beneath it and is centered on top. To make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific triangular patterns that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a single block stacked on top of two blocks. The patterns are given as a list of three-letter strings allowed, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block. For example, \"ABC\" represents a triangular pattern with a 'C' block stacked on top of an 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) block. Note that this is different from \"BAC\" where 'B' is on the left bottom and 'A' is on the right bottom. You start with a bottom row of blocks bottom, given as a single string, that you must use as the base of the pyramid. Given bottom and allowed, return true if you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such that every triangular pattern in the pyramid is in allowed, or false otherwise. Example 1: Input: bottom = \"BCD\", allowed = [\"BCC\", \"CDE\", \"CEA\", \"FFF\"] Output: true Explanation: The allowed triangular patterns are shown on the right. Starting from the bottom (level 3), we can build \"CE\" on level 2 and then build \"A\" on level 1. There are three triangular patterns in the pyramid, which are \"BCC\", \"CDE\", and \"CEA\". All are allowed. Example 2: Input: bottom = \"AAAA\", allowed = [\"AAB\", \"AAC\", \"BCD\", \"BBE\", \"DEF\"] Output: false Explanation: The allowed triangular patterns are shown on the right.

We start by initializing the number of couples `n` as the length of the given row divided by 2.\n2. We create an array `parent` with length `2 * n` where each element initially stores its own index. This will be used to keep track of the parent of each person.\n3. We create an array `ranks` with length `2 * n` where each element initially stores 0. This will be used to keep track of the rank of each person.\n4. We define the `find` function which takes an index `x` and returns the parent of that index. This function uses path compression to optimize the find operation by updating the parent of `x` to its root.\n5. We define the `union` function which takes two indexes `x` and `y` and merges the subsets containing those indexes. This function uses union by rank to optimize the union operation by always appending the shorter tree to the taller tree.\n6. We iterate through the row with a step of 2 to process each couple. For each couple, we find their corresponding indices `c1` and `c2` by dividing the values in `row` by 2. Then, we call the `union` function to merge the subsets containing `c1` and `c2`.\n7. After processing all the couples, we initialize a variable `count` to 0. We iterate through `parent` and for each index `i`, if `i` is the parent of itself (i.e., it is the root of its subset), we increment `count` by 1.\n8. The minimum number of swaps required to have every couple sitting side by side is equal to `n - count`, where `n` is the number of couples. This can be inferred by considering that each swap between two couples will reduce the number of subsets (connected components) by 1, and the goal is to have only 1 subset (all couples sitting side by side).\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the length of the row. The union-find operations take O(1) amortized time, and the final count computation takes O(N) time.", "cleaned_response": "\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minSwapsCouples(self, row: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(row) // 2\n        parent = [i for i in range(2 * n)]  # parent[i] stores the parent of i\n        ranks = [0] * (2 * n)  # ranks[i] stores the rank of i\n        \n        def find(x: int) -> int:\n            if x != parent[x]:\n                parent[x] = find(parent[x])\n            return parent[x]\n        \n        def union(x: int, y: int) -> None:\n            px = find(x)\n            py = find(y)\n            \n            if ranks[px] < ranks[py]:\n                parent[px] = py\n            elif ranks[px] > ranks[py]:\n                parent[py] = px\n            else:\n                parent[px] = py\n                ranks[py] += 1\n        \n        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):\n            c1 = row[i] // 2\n            c2 = row[i+1] // 2\n            \n            union(c1, c2)\n        \n        count = 0\n        for i in range(2 * n):\n            if find(i) == i:\n                count += 1\n        \n        return n - count\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 3.0, "frontend_question_id": 765.0, "loc": 578}

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #770\nTitle: Basic Calculator IV\nDescription:\nGiven an expression such as expression = \"e + 8 - a + 5\" and an evaluation map such as {\"e\": 1} (given in terms of evalvars = [\"e\"] and evalints = [1] ), return a list of tokens representing the simplified expression, such as [\"-1*a\", \"14\"]...\n An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol. A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer. A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits. ) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like \"2x\" or \"-x\". Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction. For example, expression = \"1 + 2 * 3\" has an answer of [\"7\"]. The format of the output is as follows: For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically. For example, we would never write a term like \"b*a*c\", only \"a*b*c\". Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term. For example, \"a*a*b*c\" has degree 4. The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist. ) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed. An example of a well-formatted answer is [\"-2*a*a*a\", \"3*a*a*b\", \"3*b*b\", \"4*a\", \"5*c\", \"-6\"]. Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included. For example, an expression of \"0\" has an output of []. Note: You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-2^31, 2^31 - 1]. Example 1: Input: expression = \"e + 8 - a + 5\", evalvars = [\"e\"], evalints = [1] Output: [\"-1*a\", \"14\"] Example 2: Input: expression = \"e - 8 + temperature - pressure\", evalvars = [\"e\", \"temperature\"], evalints = [1, 12] Output: [\"-1*pressure\", \"5\"] Example 3: Input: expression = \"(e + 8) * (e - 8)\", evalvars = [], evalints = [] Output: [\"1*e*e\", \"-64\"] Constraints: 1 <= expression.length <= 250 expression consists of lowercase English letters, digits, '+', '-', '*', '(', ')', ' '. expression does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.

The idea is to perform a binary search on the range of possible times and check if it is possible to reach the destination using each time value.\nIn the `can_reach_destination` function, we perform a BFS traversal starting from the top-left square and check if it is possible to reach the destination using the given `max_time`. We keep track of visited squares to avoid revisiting the same square. If a square's elevation is less than or equal to the `max_time`, we add it to the priority queue (heap) along with the maximum of the water level and the square's elevation. This ensures that we always have enough water to swim from one square to another without violating the time constraint. If we reach the destination square, we return True indicating that it is possible to reach the destination within the given `max_time`.

Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone. A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. For example: 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves, 2 and 5 rotate to each other (in this case they are rotated in a different direction, in other words, 2 or 5 gets mirrored), 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Example 2: Input: n = 1 Output: 0 Example 3: Input: n = 2 Output: 1 Constraints: 1 <= n <= 10e4\n", "code_prompt": "class Solution:\n    def rotatedDigits(self, n: int) -> int:\n        ", "raw_response": "### Restated Problem:\n\nGiven an integer `n`, we need to find the number of \"good\" integers in the range `[1, n]`. An integer is considered \"good\" if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we obtain a valid number that is different from the original number. Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone. A number is considered valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation.\n\n### Plan:\n\nTo solve this problem, we will iterate over all numbers from 1 to `n`. For each number, we will check if it is a \"good\" number by rotating its digits individually. If the rotated number is different from the original number and is a valid number, we will increment the count of \"good\" numbers.\n\n### Algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of \"good\" numbers.\n2. Iterate over all numbers from 1 to `n`.\n3. For each number, convert it to a string and iterate over its digits.\n4. For each digit, check if it is a valid rotation. If it is, rotate it and append the rotated digit to a list of rotated digits. If it is not a valid rotation, set the rotated digits list to None and break the loop.\n5. If the rotated digits list is not None and is different from the original digits list, increment the `count` variable by 1.\n6. Finally, return the value of `count`.\n\n### Complexity Analysis:\n\nSince we are iterating over all numbers from 1 to `n`, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n). The space complexity is O(d), where d is the number of digits in the largest number in the range [1, n].\n\n### Complete Solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def rotatedDigits(self, n: int) -> int:\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            digits = list(str(i))\n            rotated_digits = []\n            for digit in digits:\n                if digit == '0' or digit == '1' or digit == '8':\n                    rotated_digits.append(digit)\n                elif digit == '2':\n                    rotated_digits.append('5')\n                elif digit == '5':\n                    rotated_digits.append('2')\n                elif digit == '6':\n                    rotated_digits.append('9')\n                elif digit == '9':\n                    rotated_digits.append('6')\n                else:\n                    rotated_digits = None\n                    break\n            if rotated_digits is not None and rotated_digits != digits:\n                count += 1\n        return count\n```", "cleaned_response": "\nclass Solution:\n    def rotatedDigits(self, n: int) -> int:\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            digits = list(str(i))\n            rotated_digits = []\n            for digit in digits:\n                if digit == '0' or digit == '1' or digit == '8':\n                    rotated_digits.append(digit)\n                elif digit == '2':\n                    rotated_digits.append('5')\n                elif digit == '5':\n                    rotated_digits.append('2')\n                elif digit == '6':\n                    rotated_digits.append('9')\n                elif digit == '9':\n                    rotated_digits.append('6')\n                else:\n                    rotated_digits = None\n                    break\n            if rotated_digits is not None and rotated_digits != digits:\n                count += 1\n        return count\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 2.0, "frontend_question_id": 788.0, "loc": 598}

Each glass holds one cup of champagne. Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top. When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it. When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on. (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor. ) For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full. After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full. After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #803\nTitle: Bricks Falling When Hit\nDescription:\nYou are given an m x n binary grid, where each 1 represents a brick and 0 represents an empty space. A brick is stable if:...\n It is directly connected to the top of the grid, or At least one other brick in its four adjacent cells is stable. You are also given an array hits, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. Each time we want to erase the brick at the location hits[i] = (row i, col i ). The brick on that location (if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will fall. Once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from the grid (i. e. , it does not land on other stable bricks). Return an array result, where each result[i] is the number of bricks that will fall after the i th erasure is applied. Note that an erasure may refer to a location with no brick, and if it does, no bricks drop. Example 1: Input: grid = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0]], hits = [[1, 0]] Output: [2] Explanation: Starting with the grid: [[1, 0, 0, 0], [ 1, 1, 1, 0]] We erase the underlined brick at (1, 0), resulting in the grid: [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0]] The two underlined bricks are no longer stable as they are no longer connected to the top nor adjacent to another stable brick, so they will fall.

The grid remains the same: [[1, 0, 0, 0], [ 1, 0, 0, 0]] Next, we erase the underlined brick at (1, 0), resulting in the grid: [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]] Once again, all remaining bricks are still stable, so no bricks fall.

You are given a string s and an array of query strings words. A query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to s by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the group is three or more. For example, starting with \"hello\", we could do an extension on the group \"o\" to get \"hellooo\", but we cannot get \"helloo\" since the group \"oo\" has a size less than three. Also, we could do another extension like \"ll\" -> \"lllll\" to get \"helllllooo\".

Alice and Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first. If erasing a number causes the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard to become 0, then that player loses. The bitwise XOR of one element is that element itself, and the bitwise XOR of no elements is 0. Also, if any player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard equal to 0, then that player wins. Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally. Example 1: Input: nums = [1, 1, 2] Output: false Explanation: Alice has two choices: erase 1 or erase 2. If she erases 1, the nums array becomes [1, 2]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 2 = 3. Now Bob can remove any element he wants, because Alice will be the one to erase the last element and she will lose. If Alice erases 2 first, now nums become [1, 1]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 1 = 0. Alice will lose.

If it is, then Alice can always win the game by using a strategy where she erases an element such that the XOR sum of the remaining elements is equal to 0. This is because if the XOR sum is 0, Bob will be left with no choice but to erase the last element, causing him to lose.\n\nIf the length of the nums array is odd, we need to check if the XOR sum of all the elements in the array is equal to 0. If it is, then Alice will lose because she will be left with no choice but to erase an element, causing the XOR sum to be non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the final solution returns True if the length of nums is even or if the XOR sum of all the elements is 0, and False otherwise.", "cleaned_response": "\nclass Solution:\n    def xorGame(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        if len(nums) % 2 == 0:\n            return True\n        xor_sum = 0\n        for num in nums:\n            xor_sum ^= num\n        return xor_sum == 0\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 3.0, "frontend_question_id": 810.0, "loc": 619}

The approach is based on the observation that for any number `arr[i]`, we need to find all the pairs `arr[j]` and `arr[k]` such that `arr[i] = arr[j] * arr[k]`. If we can find such pairs, then the number of trees that can be formed using `arr[i]` as the root is equal to the product of the number of trees that can be formed using `arr[j]` as the left child and the number of trees that can be formed using `arr[k]` as the right child.\n\nTo implement this, we first sort the array in ascending order to ensure that we process the smaller numbers first. Then, we iterate through the array from left to right and for each number `arr[i]`, we check if there exists a number `arr[j]` (where `j` is less than `i`) that is a factor of `arr[i]`. If such a factor exists, we calculate the other factor (`arr[k]`) by dividing `arr[i]` by `arr[j]`. If both `arr[j]` and `arr[k]` are present in our dynamic programming dictionary `dp`, it means that we have already calculated the number of trees that can be formed using these factors. In that case, we update the number of trees that can be formed using `arr[i]` as the root by multiplying the number of trees that can be formed using `arr[j]` as the left child and the number of trees that can be formed using `arr[k]` as the right child.\n\nFinally, we return the sum of all the values in `dp` modulo `10^9 + 7`, which gives us the number of binary trees that can be formed.", "cleaned_response": "\nclass Solution:\n    def numFactoredBinaryTrees(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7\n        arr.sort() # Sort the array in ascending order\n        dp = {}\n        \n        for i in range(len(arr)):\n            dp[arr[i]] = 1 # Each individual number can form a single tree\n        \n            for j in range(i):\n                if arr[i] % arr[j] == 0: # If arr[j] is a factor of arr[i]\n                    complement = arr[i] // arr[j] # Calculate the other factor\n                    if complement in dp:\n                        dp[arr[i]] += dp[arr[j]] * dp[complement] # Update the number of trees we can make\n                \n        return sum(dp.values()) % MOD\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 2.0, "frontend_question_id": 823.0, "loc": 632}

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times. For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0. Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs. Example 1: Input: difficulty = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], profit = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], worker = [4, 5, 6, 7] Output: 100 Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4, 4, 6, 6] and they get a profit of [20, 20, 30, 30] separately.

For example, calling countUniqueChars(s) if s = \"LEETCODE\" then \"L\", \"T\", \"C\", \"O\", \"D\" are the unique characters since they appear only once in s, therefore countUniqueChars(s) = 5.

Sum of lengths of all substring is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10 Example 2: Input: s = \"ABA\" Output: 8 Explanation: The same as example 1, except countUniqueChars (\"ABA\") = 1.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #833\nTitle: Find And Replace in String\nDescription:\nYou are given a 0-indexed string s that you must perform k replacement operations on. The replacement operations are given as three 0-indexed parallel arrays, indices, sources, and targets, all of length k. To complete the i th replacement operation: Check if the substring sources[i] occurs at index indices[i] in the original string s. If it does not occur, do nothing. Otherwise if it does occur, replace that substring with targets[i]. For example, if s = \" ab cd\", indices[i] = 0, sources[i] = \"ab\", and targets[i] = \"eee\", then the result of this replacement will be \" eee cd\". All replacement operations must occur simultaneously, meaning the replacement operations should not affect the indexing of each other. The testcases will be generated such that the replacements will not overlap. For example, a testcase with s = \"abc\", indices = [0, 1], and sources = [\"ab\", \"bc\"] will not be generated because the \"ab\" and \"bc\" replacements overlap. Return the resulting string after performing all replacement operations on s. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

A binary matrix has only 0 s and 1 s as values. We translate one image however we choose by sliding all the 1 bits left, right, up, and/or down any number of units. We then place it on top of the other image. We can then calculate the overlap by counting the number of positions that have a 1 in both images. Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation. Any 1 bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased. Return the largest possible overlap.

Formally, a Fibonacci-like sequence is a list f of non-negative integers such that: 0 <= f[i] < 2^31, (that is, each integer fits in a 32-bit signed integer type), f.length >= 3, and f[i] + f[i + 1] == f[i + 2] for all 0 <= i < f.length - 2. Note that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.

One word of words was chosen as a secret word. You are also given the helper object Master. You may call Master. guess(word) where word is a six-letter-long string, and it must be from words. Master. guess(word) returns: -1 if word is not from words, or an integer representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word. There is a parameter allowedGuesses for each test case where allowedGuesses is the maximum number of times you can call Master. guess(word). For each test case, you should call Master. guess with the secret word without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get: \"Either you took too many guesses, or you did not find the secret word. \" if you called Master. guess more than allowedGuesses times or if you did not call Master. guess with the secret word, or \"You guessed the secret word correctly. \" if you called Master. guess with the secret word with the number of calls to Master. guess less than or equal to allowedGuesses. The test cases are generated such that you can guess the secret word with a reasonable strategy (other than using the bruteforce method). Example 1: Input: secret = \"acckzz\", words = [\"acckzz\", \"ccbazz\", \"eiowzz\", \"abcczz\"], allowedGuesses = 10 Output: You guessed the secret word correctly. Explanation: master. guess(\"aaaaaa\") returns -1, because \"aaaaaa\" is not in wordlist. master. guess(\"acckzz\") returns 6, because \"acckzz\" is secret and has all 6 matches. master. guess(\"ccbazz\") returns 3, because \"ccbazz\" has 3 matches. master. guess(\"eiowzz\") returns 2, because \"eiowzz\" has 2 matches. master. guess(\"abcczz\") returns 4, because \"abcczz\" has 4 matches. We made 5 calls to master. guess, and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.

We define three helper functions: match, shrink, and findSecretWordHelper.\n\nThe match function takes in two words and returns the number of matching characters at the same position.\n\nThe shrink function takes in a list of words, a guess word, and the number of matching characters with the secret word. It returns a new list of words that have the same number of matching characters with the guess word.\n\nThe findSecretWordHelper function takes in a list of words, the master object, and the number of guesses remaining. It is a recursive function that performs the following steps:\n1. Check if there are no more remaining guesses. If so, return.\n2. Set the guess word as the first word in the list.\n3. Call the master's guess method and store the number of matching characters.\n4. If all characters match, return.\n5.

Given two anagrams s1 and s2, return the smallest k for which s1 and s2 are k -similar.

While the queue is not empty:\n    - Dequeue a string from the queue.\n    - If the dequeued string is equal to s2, return `k`.\n    - Mark the dequeued string as visited.\n    - Find the first character in the dequeued string that doesn't match the corresponding character in s2.\n    - For each character at this position in s2:\n        - If the character is equal to the mismatch character in the dequeued string and the new string doesn't exist in the visited set:\n            - Swap the mismatch character with the current character in s2.\n            - Enqueue the new string.\n    - Increment `k` by 1.\n5.

If such a prefix sum exists, we update the minimum length of the subarray. We then remove any indices from the front of the deque (`idx_queue`) that are no longer valid for future calculations.\n\nNext, we remove any indices from the back of the deque (`idx_queue`) if the corresponding prefix sums are greater than the current prefix sum `prefix_sum[i]`. This ensures that the deque maintains an increasing order of prefix sums.\n\nFinally, we add the current index `i` to the deque and repeat the process for the next prefix sum.\n\nAt the end, we return the minimum length of the subarray if it exists, otherwise return -1.", "cleaned_response": "\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSubarray(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]\n        \n        idx_queue = collections.deque()\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        \n        for i in range(n + 1):\n            while idx_queue and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[idx_queue[0]] >= k:\n                min_length = min(min_length, i - idx_queue.popleft())\n            \n            while idx_queue and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[idx_queue[-1]]:\n                idx_queue.pop()\n            \n            idx_queue.append(i)\n        \n        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 3.0, "frontend_question_id": 862.0, "loc": 671}

Lowercase letters represent keys. Uppercase letters represent locks. You start at the starting point and one move consists of walking one space in one of the four cardinal directions. You cannot walk outside the grid, or walk into a wall. If you walk over a key, you can pick it up and you cannot walk over a lock unless you have its corresponding key. For some 1 <= k <= 6, there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first k letters of the English alphabet in the grid. This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each key; and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the same order as the English alphabet. Return the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys. If it is impossible, return -1. Example 1: Input: grid = [\"@. a. . \", \"###. #\", \"b. A.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #865\nTitle: Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes\nDescription:\nGiven the root of a binary tree, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root. Return the smallest subtree such that it contains all the deepest nodes in the original tree. A node is called the deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree. The subtree of a node is a tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node. Example 1: Input: root = [3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, null, null, 7, 4] Output: [2, 7, 4] Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram. The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree. Notice that nodes 5, 3 and 2 contain the deepest nodes in the tree but node 2 is the smallest subtree among them, so we return it. Example 2: Input: root = [1] Output: [1] Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree. Example 3: Input: root = [0, 1, 3, null, 2] Output: [2] Explanation: The deepest node in the tree is 2, the valid subtrees are the subtrees of nodes 2, 1 and 0 but the subtree of node 2 is the smallest. Constraints: The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 500]. 0 <= Node. val <= 500 The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #871\nTitle: Minimum Number of Refueling Stops\nDescription:\nA car travels from a starting position to a destination which is target miles east of the starting position. There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array stations where stations[i] = [position i, fuel i ] indicates that the i th gas station is position i miles east of the starting position and has fuel i liters of gas. The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car. Return the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination. If it cannot reach the destination, return -1. Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived. Example 1: Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = [] Output: 0 Explanation: We can reach the target without refueling. Example 2: Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10, 100]] Output: -1 Explanation: We can not reach the target (or even the first gas station). Example 3: Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10, 60], [20, 30], [30, 30], [60, 40]] Output: 2 Explanation: We start with 10 liters of fuel. We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel. We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas. Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60 (expending 50 liters of fuel), and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas. We then drive to and reach the target. We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.

It creates a 2D array `dp` to store the number of schemes for each profit and group size. The base case is set to `dp[0][0] = 1`, indicating that there is 1 scheme with no members and no profit.\n\nThen, the code iterates through each crime and each possible group size and profit.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #891\nTitle: Sum of Subsequence Widths\nDescription:\nThe width of a sequence is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sequence. Given an array of integers nums, return the sum of the widths of all the non-empty subsequences of nums. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10e9 + 7. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3, 6, 2, 7] is a subsequence of the array [0, 3, 1, 6, 2, 2, 7]. Example 1: Input: nums = [2, 1, 3] Output: 6 Explanation: The subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [2, 1], [2, 3], [1, 3], [2, 1, 3]. The corresponding widths are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2. The sum of these widths is 6.

We start by sorting the array in ascending order because the width of a subsequence only depends on the minimum and maximum elements. Sorting the array makes it easier to calculate the width.\n2. We initialize a variable `n` to store the length of the array `nums`.\n3. We initialize a list `power` to keep track of the powers of 2 modulo `mod`. This will be used to calculate the widths later.\n4. We iterate over the array `nums` and calculate the powers of 2 modulo `mod` using the previous power in the list `power`.\n5. We initialize a variable `width_sum` to store the sum of the widths of all non-empty subsequences.\n6. We iterate over the sorted array `nums` and calculate the width for each element. The width of an element at index `i` is equal to `nums[i] * (power[i] - power[n-1-i])`. We add this width to `width_sum` and take modulo `mod` to avoid overflow.\n7. Finally, we return the modulo `mod` of `width_sum`.\n\nThe overall time complexity of this solution is O(NlogN), where N is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we are sorting the array before calculating the widths.", "cleaned_response": "\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def sumSubseqWidths(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Sort the array in ascending order\n        nums.sort()\n        \n        n = len(nums)\n        \n        # Initialize variables to keep track of the powers of 2\n        mod = 10**9 + 7\n        power = [1]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            power.append(power[-1] * 2 % mod)\n        \n        # Calculate the sum of widths of all non-empty subsequences\n        width_sum = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            width_sum = (width_sum + nums[i] * (power[i] - power[n-1-i])) % mod\n        \n        return width_sum\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 3.0, "frontend_question_id": 891.0, "loc": 700}

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #913\nTitle: Cat and Mouse\nDescription:\nA game on an undirected graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns. The graph is given as follows: graph[a] is a list of all nodes b such that ab is an edge of the graph. The mouse starts at node 1 and goes first, the cat starts at node 2 and goes second, and there is a hole at node 0. During each player's turn, they must travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are. For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it must travel to any node in graph[1]. Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0. ) Then, the game can end in three ways: If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins. If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins. If ever a position is repeated (i. e. , the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw. Given a graph, and assuming both players play optimally, return 1 if the mouse wins the game, 2 if the cat wins the game, or 0 if the game is a draw.

Then, it iterates through the `deck` array and updates the counts in the dictionary.\n\nNext, the function finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the card counts in the `card_count` dictionary. This is done using the helper function `find_gcd`.\n\nFinally, the function checks if the gcd is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, it means there is a valid partition and the function returns True.

Some nodes initial are initially infected by malware. Whenever two nodes are directly connected, and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware. This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner. Suppose M(initial) is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network after the spread of malware stops. We will remove exactly one node from initial.

The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid.

In the above example ( 0-indexed ), columns 0 ( 'a', 'b', 'c' ) and 2 ( 'c', 'e', 'e' ) are sorted, while column 1 ( 'b', 'c', 'a' ) is not, so you would delete column 1. Return the number of columns that you will delete. Example 1: Input: strs = [\"cba\", \"daf\", \"ghi\"] Output: 1 Explanation: The grid looks as follows: cba daf ghi Columns 0 and 2 are sorted, but column 1 is not, so you only need to delete 1 column. Example 2: Input: strs = [\"a\", \"b\"] Output: 0 Explanation: The grid looks as follows: a b Column 0 is the only column and is sorted, so you will not delete any columns. Example 3: Input: strs = [\"zyx\", \"wvu\", \"tsr\"] Output: 3 Explanation: The grid looks as follows: zyx wvu tsr All 3 columns are not sorted, so you will delete all 3.

Example 1: Input: stones = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1], [2, 2]] Output: 5 Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows: 1. Remove stone [2, 2] because it shares the same row as [2, 1]. 2. Remove stone [2, 1] because it shares the same column as [0, 1]. 3. Remove stone [1, 2] because it shares the same row as [1, 0]. 4. Remove stone [1, 0] because it shares the same column as [0, 0]. 5. Remove stone [0, 1] because it shares the same row as [0, 0]. Stone [0, 0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane. Example 2: Input: stones = [[0, 0], [0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 0], [2, 2]] Output: 3 Explanation: One way to make 3 moves is as follows: 1. Remove stone [2, 2] because it shares the same row as [2, 0]. 2. Remove stone [2, 0] because it shares the same column as [0, 0]. 3. Remove stone [0, 2] because it shares the same row as [0, 0]. Stones [0, 0] and [1, 1] cannot be removed since they do not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane. Example 3: Input: stones = [[0, 0]] Output: 0 Explanation: [0, 0] is the only stone on the plane, so you cannot remove it.

We may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string. For example, if we have strs = [\"abcdef\", \"uvwxyz\"] and deletion indices {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is [\"bef\", \"vyz\"].

Return the minimum possible value of answer.length. Example 1: Input: strs = [\"ca\", \"bb\", \"ac\"] Output: 1 Explanation: After deleting the first column, strs = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]. Now strs is in lexicographic order (ie. strs[0] <= strs[1] <= strs[2]). We require at least 1 deletion since initially strs was not in lexicographic order, so the answer is 1. Example 2: Input: strs = [\"xc\", \"yb\", \"za\"] Output: 0 Explanation: strs is already in lexicographic order, so we do not need to delete anything. Note that the rows of strs are not necessarily in lexicographic order: i. e. , it is NOT necessarily true that (strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] <=. . . ) Example 3: Input: strs = [\"zyx\", \"wvu\", \"tsr\"] Output: 3 Explanation: We have to delete every column.

The main idea is to store the maximum length of a steel support that can be achieved for each possible height difference.\n\nFirst, we initialize a dictionary `dp` with a single entry, where the key is 0 (representing a height difference of 0) and the value is also 0 (representing the maximum length of the steel support for a height difference of 0).\n\nThen, for each rod in the input list, we create a new dictionary `new_dp` to store the updated maximum lengths.\n\nNext, we iterate through each height difference in the `dp` dictionary. For each height difference, we consider two cases:\n1. If we add the current rod to the left side of the steel support, the new height difference becomes `diff + rod`. If this new height difference already exists in `new_dp`, we update the maximum length by taking the maximum of the current maximum length for that height difference and the sum of the current maximum length for `diff` and the length of the current rod. Otherwise, we add a new entry to `new_dp` with the new height difference and the sum of the current maximum length for `diff` and the length of the current rod.\n2. If we add the current rod to the right side of the steel support, the new height difference becomes `diff - rod`. If this new height difference already exists in `new_dp`, we update the maximum length by taking the maximum of the current maximum length for that height difference and the current maximum length for `diff`. Otherwise, we add a new entry to `new_dp` with the new height difference and the current maximum length for `diff`.\n\nAfter iterating through all height differences, we update the `dp` dictionary with the updated maximum lengths from `new_dp`.\n\nFinally, we return the maximum length of the steel support with a height difference of 0 from the `dp` dictionary, if it exists. Otherwise, we return 0 to indicate that the billboard cannot be supported.", "cleaned_response": "\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def tallestBillboard(self, rods: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Create a dictionary to store the maximum length of steel support for a given height difference\n        dp = {0: 0}\n        \n        # Iterate through each rod\n        for rod in rods:\n            # Create a new dictionary to store the updated maximum length of steel support\n            new_dp = dp.copy()\n            \n            # Iterate through each height difference in the current dictionary\n            for diff in dp:\n                # If we can add the current rod to the left side of the steel support, update the maximum length\n                if diff + rod in new_dp:\n                    new_dp[diff + rod] = max(new_dp[diff + rod], dp[diff] + rod)\n                else:\n                    new_dp[diff + rod] = dp[diff] + rod\n                \n                # If we can add the current rod to the right side of the steel support, update the maximum length\n                if diff - rod in new_dp:\n                    new_dp[diff - rod] = max(new_dp[diff - rod], dp[diff])\n                else:\n                    new_dp[diff - rod] = dp[diff]\n            \n            # Update the current dictionary with the updated maximum lengths\n            dp = new_dp\n        \n        # Return the maximum length of the steel support with a height difference of 0, if it exists\n        return dp.get(0, 0)\n", "n_pass": 1, "difficulty": 3.0, "frontend_question_id": 956.0, "loc": 765}

For example, with x = 3, we might write 3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3 which is a value of 3. When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions: The division operator ( / ) returns rational numbers. There are no parentheses placed anywhere. We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction. It is not allowed to use the unary negation operator ( - ). For example, \" x - x \" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but \" -x + x \" is not because it uses negation. We would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the expression equals the given target. Return the least number of operators used.

For a given query word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling mistakes: Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist ( case-insensitive ), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist. Example: wordlist = [\"yellow\"], query = \"YellOw\" : correct = \"yellow\" Example: wordlist = [\"Yellow\"], query = \"yellow\" : correct = \"Yellow\" Example: wordlist = [\"yellow\"], query = \"yellow\" : correct = \"yellow\" Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist ( case-insensitive ), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist. Example: wordlist = [\"YellOw\"], query = \"yollow\" : correct = \"YellOw\" Example: wordlist = [\"YellOw\"], query = \"yeellow\" : correct = \"\" (no match) Example: wordlist = [\"YellOw\"], query = \"yllw\" : correct = \"\" (no match) In addition, the spell checker operates under the following precedence rules: When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist ( case-sensitive ), you should return the same word back. When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the first such match in the wordlist. When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first such match in the wordlist. If the query has no matches in the wordlist, you should return the empty string.

Example 1: Input: points = [[1, 3], [-2, 2]], k = 1 Output: [[-2, 2]] Explanation: The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10). The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8). Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin. We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2, 2]]. Example 2: Input: points = [[3, 3], [5, -1], [-2, 4]], k = 2 Output: [[3, 3], [-2, 4]] Explanation: The answer [[-2, 4], [3, 3]] would also be accepted.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #975\nTitle: Odd Even Jump\nDescription:\nYou are given an integer array arr. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1 st, 3 rd, 5 th,. . . ) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2 nd, 4 th, 6 th,. . . ) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices. You may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j ) in the following way: During odd-numbered jumps (i. e. , jumps 1, 3, 5,. . . ), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j. During even-numbered jumps (i. e. , jumps 2, 4, 6,. . . ), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] >= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j. It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps. A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1 ) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once). Return the number of good starting indices. Example 1: Input: arr = [10, 13, 12, 14, 15] Output: 2 Explanation: From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more. From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more. From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end. From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already. In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of jumps. Example 2: Input: arr = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4] Output: 3 Explanation: From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3: During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0]. During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3 During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2]. We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good. In a similar manner, we can deduce that: From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end. From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore. From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end. From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end. In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of jumps. Example 3: Input: arr = [5, 1, 3, 4, 2] Output: 3 Explanation: We can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.

If the bitwise AND result is 0, it means that nums[i] & nums[j] & nums[k] == 0. In this case, there are n^3 possible combinations for the triple (i, j, k), where n is the length of nums.\n2. If the bitwise AND result is not 0, it finds the complement of the result by using the bitwise NOT operator (~) and bitwise-ANDing with 0xFFFF (to limit the result to 16 bits).

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #987\nTitle: Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree\nDescription:\nGiven the root of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of the binary tree. For each node at position (row, col), its left and right children will be at positions (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) respectively. The root of the tree is at (0, 0). The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values. Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree. Example 1: Input: root = [3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7] Output: [[9], [3, 15], [20], [7]] Explanation: Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column. Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom. Column 1: Only node 20 is in this column. Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column. Example 2: Input: root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] Output: [[4], [2], [1, 5, 6], [3], [7]] Explanation: Column -2: Only node 4 is in this column. Column -1: Only node 2 is in this column. Column 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column. 1 is at the top, so it comes first. 5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their value, 5 before 6.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #1001\nTitle: Grid Illumination\nDescription:\nThere is a 2D grid of size n x n where each cell of this grid has a lamp that is initially turned off. You are given a 2D array of lamp positions lamps, where lamps[i] = [row i, col i ] indicates that the lamp at grid[row i ][col i ] is turned on. Even if the same lamp is listed more than once, it is turned on. When a lamp is turned on, it illuminates its cell and all other cells in the same row, column, or diagonal. You are also given another 2D array queries, where queries[j] = [row j, col j ]. For the j th query, determine whether grid[row j ][col j ] is illuminated or not. After answering the j th query, turn off the lamp at grid[row j ][col j ] and its 8 adjacent lamps if they exist. A lamp is adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with grid[row j ][col j ]. Return an array of integers ans, where ans[j] should be 1 if the cell in the j th query was illuminated, or 0 if the lamp was not. Example 1: Input: n = 5, lamps = [[0, 0], [4, 4]], queries = [[1, 1], [1, 0]] Output: [1, 0] Explanation: We have the initial grid with all lamps turned off. In the above picture we see the grid after turning on the lamp at grid[0][0] then turning on the lamp at grid[4][4]. The 0 th query asks if the lamp at grid[1][1] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is illuminated, so set ans[0] = 1. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red square. The 1 st query asks if the lamp at grid[1][0] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is not illuminated, so set ans[1] = 0. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red rectangle.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #1006\nTitle: Clumsy Factorial\nDescription:\nThe factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. We make a clumsy factorial using the integers in decreasing order by swapping out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations with multiply '*', divide '/', add '+', and subtract '-' in this order. For example, clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1. However, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic. We do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right. Additionally, the division that we use is floor division such that 10 * 9 / 8 = 90 / 8 = 11. Given an integer n, return the clumsy factorial of n.

We use a stack to keep track of the nodes that we have encountered so far. We start by creating the root node based on the first number in the traversal string. Then, for each subsequent number, we check its depth by counting the number of dashes before it. If the depth is equal to the current depth + 1, it means that the current number is the child of the last node in the stack, so we create a new node and add it as the left or right child of the last node. If the depth is less than or equal to the current depth, it means that we have finished traversing the children of the last node, so we pop it from the stack and update the current depth accordingly. The algorithm continues until we have processed all numbers in the traversal string.

We start at the source = [s x, s y ] square and want to reach the target = [t x, t y ] square. There is also an array of blocked squares, where each blocked[i] = [x i, y i ] represents a blocked square with coordinates (x i, y i ). Each move, we can walk one square north, east, south, or west if the square is not in the array of blocked squares. We are also not allowed to walk outside of the grid. Return true if and only if it is possible to reach the target square from the source square through a sequence of valid moves. Example 1: Input: blocked = [[0, 1], [1, 0]], source = [0, 0], target = [0, 2] Output: false Explanation: The target square is inaccessible starting from the source square because we cannot move.

The DFS function `dfs()` takes in the current coordinates (x, y), the blocked squares, and the visited squares as parameters.\n\nIn each recursive call, it first checks if the current coordinates are out of bounds, in a blocked square, or already visited. If any of these conditions is true, it returns False.\n\nThen, it checks if the current coordinates are equal to the target coordinates.

You are given an integer array values where values[i] is the value of the i th vertex (i. e. , clockwise order ). You will triangulate the polygon into n - 2 triangles. For each triangle, the value of that triangle is the product of the values of its vertices, and the total score of the triangulation is the sum of these values over all n - 2 triangles in the triangulation. Return the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon.

{"task_input": "\nLeetCode Problem #1061\nTitle: Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String\nDescription:\nYou are given two strings of the same length s1 and s2 and a string baseStr. We say s1[i] and s2[i] are equivalent characters. For example, if s1 = \"abc\" and s2 = \"cde\", then we have 'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', and 'c' == 'e'. Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation: Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'. Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'. Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'. For example, given the equivalency information from s1 = \"abc\" and s2 = \"cde\", \"acd\" and \"aab\" are equivalent strings of baseStr = \"eed\", and \"aab\" is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr. Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr by using the equivalency information from s1 and s2. Example 1: Input: s1 = \"parker\", s2 = \"morris\", baseStr = \"parser\" Output: \"makkek\" Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [m, p], [a, o], [k, r, s], [e, i]. The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order. So the answer is \"makkek\". Example 2: Input: s1 = \"hello\", s2 = \"world\", baseStr = \"hold\" Output: \"hdld\" Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [h, w], [d, e, o], [l, r]. So only the second letter 'o' in baseStr is changed to 'd', the answer is \"hdld\". Example 3: Input: s1 = \"leetcode\", s2 = \"programs\", baseStr = \"sourcecode\" Output: \"aauaaaaada\" Explanation: We group the equivalent characters in s1 and s2 as [a, o, e, r, s, c], [l, p], [g, t] and [d, m], thus all letters in baseStr except 'u' and 'd' are transformed to 'a', the answer is \"aauaaaaada\".

If the characters at the current positions in str1 and str2 are the same, we add the character to the supersequence and move diagonally up-left. Otherwise, we add the character that leads to a longer common subsequence and move either up or left.\n4.

Let R(expr) denote the set of words the expression represents. The grammar can best be understood through simple examples: Single letters represent a singleton set containing that word. R(\"a\") = {\"a\"} R(\"w\") = {\"w\"} When we take a comma-delimited list of two or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities. R(\"{a, b, c}\") = {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"} R(\"{{a, b}, {b, c}}\") = {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"} (notice the final set only contains each word at most once) When we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes from the second expression. R(\"{a, b}{c, d}\") = {\"ac\", \"ad\", \"bc\", \"bd\"} R(\"a{b, c}{d, e}f{g, h}\") = {\"abdfg\", \"abdfh\", \"abefg\", \"abefh\", \"acdfg\", \"acdfh\", \"acefg\", \"acefh\"} Formally, the three rules for our grammar: For every lowercase letter x, we have R(x) = {x}. For expressions e 1, e 2,. . . , e k with k >= 2, we have R({e 1, e 2,. . . }) = R(e 1 ) \u222a R(e 2 ) \u222a. . . For expressions e 1 and e 2, we have R(e 1 + e 2 ) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e 1 ) \u00d7 R(e 2 )}, where + denotes concatenation, and \u00d7 denotes the cartesian product. Given an expression representing a set of words under the given grammar, return the sorted list of words that the expression represents. Example 1: Input: expression = \"{a, b}{c, {d, e}}\" Output: [\"ac\", \"ad\", \"ae\", \"bc\", \"bd\", \"be\"] Example 2: Input: expression = \"{{a, z}, a{b, c}, {ab, z}}\" Output: [\"a\", \"ab\", \"ac\", \"z\"] Explanation: Each distinct word is written only once in the final answer.

Then, we go back to the start of the row, giving n + 1 candies to the first person, n + 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give 2 * n candies to the last person.
